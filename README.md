# Cricket-Duel-Hand-Strike

Welcome to the Hand Cricket Game!

## Description
This is a simple console-based Hand Cricket game where you can play against the computer. The game consists of two phases: batting and bowling. The player who scores the highest runs wins the game.

## How to Play
- You will bat first. Enter any number from 1 to 6. This will count as your score.
- If the number you entered matches the number generated by the console, you're out.
- After your batting turn, you will bowl. The rules are the same, but reversed. If the number you enter matches the console's number, the console is out.
- The player (you or the console) with the highest score wins.

**Warning:** If you enter a number greater than 6, you will be declared out immediately.
